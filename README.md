# CRUD App with React, Firestore, and Firebase Authentication

This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React.js for the frontend, Firestore for the backend, and Firebase Authentication for user authentication. The application allows users to manage a list of items stored in a Firestore database securely, with authentication features to ensure data security and user privacy.

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - **Sign Up**: Users can create a new account by providing their email and password.
  - **Sign In**: Registered users can sign in securely using their email and password credentials.
  - **Sign Out**: Users can sign out of their account to securely end their session.
  - **Email Verification**: After signing up, users receive a verification email to confirm their email address.
- **Protected Routes**:
  - Certain routes in the application are protected and require users to sign in before accessing them. Unauthorized users are redirected to the sign-in page.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - **Add New Item**: Users can add new items to the list by providing a name for the item.
  - **Update Item**: Users can update the name of an existing item in the list.
  - **Delete Item**: Users can delete items from the list.
